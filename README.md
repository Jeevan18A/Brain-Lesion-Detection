# Abstract
Brain lesion segmentation is crucial for neuroimaging diagnosis of diseases like tumors, strokes, and multiple sclerosis. This paper explores 3D CNNs and U-Net for this task, leveraging the BRATS 2021 dataset. 3D CNNs excel at extracting spatial features for lesions across multiple MRI slices, while U-Net's architecture with skip connections enables precise lesion boundary delineation. Evaluated using Dice Coefficient, Accuracy, Sensitivity, and Specificity, the models show strong potential, with 3D CNN achieving 99.27% accuracy and U-Net reaching 98.95%. Visual comparisons further demonstrate their effectiveness. This work highlights deep learning's role in providing accurate and consistent lesion localization for radiologists, aiding diagnosis and treatment decisions. Future work includes improving model generalization and integrating multi-omics data.
